    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to study binary systems of compact objects: I set out to animate their orbits and generate graphs of their gravitational wave (GW) signatures. Due to constraints on available computing power and my limited familiarity with General Relativity, I will not be able to produce a fully relativistic simulation (see Luc Blanchet <i>Gravitational Radiation from Post-Newtonian Sources and Inspiralling Compact Binaries</i> to get an idea of how complicated the formulation of relativistic compact binary orbits and their gravitational radiation). Given this, I will instead focus on what is often referred to as the \"post-Newtonian\" limit, where the orbits are those of Newtonian gravity and GWs are produced as quadrupole radiation."

    "## Background ##\n",
    "\n",
    "General Relativity (GR) is a relativistic theory of gravity that revolutionized how we understand gravity. It recast gravity as the result of curved <i>spacetime</i>: no longer was time a universal parameter that all observers agreed on, time was instead to be treated as a coordinate itself. In this framework, Newtonian gravity arises simply from the curvature of time, with spatial curvature giving rise to more exotic effects (such as the precession of periastron). Perhaps the most important construct in GR is the metric: not only does it tell us how to measure distances in spacetime, but it also provides us with the relativistic equations of motion (if we are clever enough to figure out the form of the metric, that is). Now, to address the issue of determing the form of the metric--this is accomplished by solving Einstein's equation. In geometrized units (where $c = G = 1$), this takes the form $G^{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi T^{\\mu\\nu}$. This is actually a system of 16 nonlinear, coupled, partial differential equations whose solution gives the components of the metric, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. Roughly speaking, Einstein's equation relates the curvature of spacetime ($G^{\\mu\\nu}$) to the energy-momentum content ($T^{\\mu\\nu}$) of the particular region of spacetime in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before going any further, I would like to take a moment to speak about notation and define some simple objects. Above, I wrote the field equations in <i>component form</i> using <i>index notation</i>: ${R^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ represents the <i>components</i> of a rank-4 tensor of type $\\binom{1}{3}$. If we let the indices $\\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta\\}$ take on values from the set $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, then ${R^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ can be regarded as a collection of 256 numbers, whose values are obtained by \"feeding\" the tensor <b>R</b> the basis dual-vector $\\omega^\\alpha$ and the basis vectors $e_\\beta, e_\\gamma, e_\\delta$. Now, for the reader unfamiliar with tensors, you can think of a tensor as a function that produces a real number when provided with the appropriate number of vectors/dual-vectors (also known as <i>one-forms</i>) as determined by its rank. Similarly, vectors can be regarded as linear maps of one-forms to the reals, and vice-versa. Further--and this is what makes tensors so crucial to GR--, tensors are <i>frame-invariant</i> objects: their properties do <i>not</i> depend on the coordinate system in which they are described. Let us not, however, get caught up in the formalism of tensors (if you'd like to further explore them in the context of GR, see Bernard Schutz's <i>A First Course in General Relativity</i>)--the following paragraph shall discuss the basic concepts that will be used throughout the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the metric is called what it is for a good reason: it induces an inner product on the four-dimensional manifolds of spacetime. So it is with the metric that we get the line element:\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{d}l^2 = \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\mathrm{d}x^\\alpha\\mathrm{d}x^\\beta $$\n",
    "Now, sums like this appear all over the place, so it is common practice to use the <i>Einstein summation convention</i>:\n",
    "$$ R_{\\alpha\\beta} = {R^\\sigma}_{\\alpha\\sigma\\beta} := \\sum_\\sigma {R^\\sigma}_{\\alpha\\sigma\\beta} $$\n",
    "Using this convention, repeated indices (when one index is a superscript, or \"up,\" and the other index is a subscript, or \"down\") imply sums over those indices; a repeated index is usually referred to as a <i>dummy index</i>, with non-repeated indices referred to as <i>free</i>, in that they are free to vary over each value they may take on. So ${R^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\alpha\\delta}$ is a rank-2 tensor (since it has two free indices), generated by <i>contracting</i> the rank-4 tensor ${R^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ over its first and third indices (<i>contraction</i> can be thought of as a more general notion of taking the trace of a matrix, since the trace of a square matrix can be written as ${I^\\alpha}_\\alpha$). Just as sums appear all over the place, so do derivatives; hence, it makes sense to develop a convention for compact derivative notation. In this paper, I will use what I call the \"comma-semicolon\" notation for derivatives. A comma denotes the partial derivative with respect to whatever index follows the comma (note that the coordinate $x^0$ usually refers to time):\n",
    "$$ {V^\\alpha}_{,\\beta} := \\frac{\\partial V^\\alpha}{\\partial x^\\beta}, \\quad q_{xx,00} = \\frac{\\partial^2q_{xx}}{\\partial t^2} $$\n",
    "whereas a semicolon denotes that the <i>covariant derivative</i> (the frame-invariant way of differentiating tensors) should be taken:\n",
    "$$ {V^\\alpha}_{;\\beta} := {V^\\alpha}_{,\\beta} + {\\Gamma^\\alpha}_{\\lambda\\beta}V^\\lambda $$\n",
    "Where the Christoffel symbol, ${\\Gamma^\\alpha}_{\\beta\\delta}$, is a collection of numbers that determines how the components of a vector must change in response to how the basis vectors change as the derivative is taken over a path. This paper will not need to use the covariant derivative anywhere, so this is the last you will see of the Christoffel symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us return our attention to the metric. Not only does it tell us how to measure spacetime distances, but it also allows us to \"raise\" and \"lower\" indices by contracting the index to be raised or lowered with one index of the metric (the metric index used is unimportant, as the metric is symmetric):\n",
    "$$ V^\\alpha = g^{\\alpha\\beta}V_\\beta \\qquad \\mathrm{and} \\qquad R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta} = g_{\\alpha\\sigma}{R^\\sigma}_{\\beta\\gamma\\delta} $$\n",
    "In the complete absence of gravity, the metric takes the form $\\mathrm{diag}(-1,1,1,1)$--this is called the <i>flat-space metric</i> and is denoted by the symbol $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$. In situations where the effects of gravity are weak (where the curvature of spacetime is small), we can represent the metric as a series expansion of perturbations to the metric:\n",
    "$$ g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} + h_{\\mu\\nu} + O(h^2) \\qquad \\mathrm{where} \\quad \\|h_{\\mu\\nu}\\| \\ll 1 $$\n",
    "For the duration of this paper, I will be working with <i>linearized gravity</i> (often referred to as the <i>weak-field limit</i>), where the metric takes the form $g_{\\mu\\nu} \\approx \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} + h_{\\mu\\nu}$. Note that, in this limit, indices are raised and lowered with the flat-space metric (since we're only working to leading order in $h_{\\mu\\nu}$). Hopefully, the background information provided in these paragraphs is sufficient for understanding the remainder of the paper, as I now move to discuss the main content of this paper: the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) by binary star systems."

    "## Gravitational Waves ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Generation of Gravitational Waves ###\n",
    "Let us begin by considering Einstein's equation in the weak-field limit, in the vacuum of space. In the vacuum, the stress-energy tensor, $T^{\\mu\\nu}$, vanishes and the field equations reduce to:\n",
    "$$ \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + \\nabla^2\\right)\\bar{h}_{\\mu\\nu} = 0 $$\n",
    "Note that this equation isn't simply in the metric perturbation; it instead uses the \"trace-reverse\" of the perturbation, defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{h}^{\\mu\\nu} := h^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}{h^\\alpha}_\\alpha $$\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, it turns out that the solution to this differential equation is a wave (perhaps somewhat surprisingly, though, these waves propagate at the speed of light). So linearized gravity in a vacuum immediately predicts the existence of gravitational waves (it is important to note, however, that this was insufficient for justifying the existence of physical GWs prior to the direct detection made by researchers at LIGO--some prominent physicists even went so far as to claim that GWs are fictitious, and that the general solution to Einstein's equation in the vacuum doesn't allow for physical GWs). However, we cannot stop there--surely, gravitational waves must have a source, so we must explore the field equations for a nontrivial stress-energy tensor. I'll spare you the finer details of the calculation (it can be found in most--if not all--introductory textbooks on the subject), but the result we get is as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{h}_{jk}(t, x^i) = -\\frac{2}{r}q_{jk,00}(t-r) $$\n",
    "where $r = \\|x^i\\|$, $\\{j,k\\}$ are spatial indices (so take on values from the set $\\{1,2,3\\}$), $q_{jk}$ is the <i>quadrupole moment tensor</i> (to be defined below), and a comma indicates a partial derivative (or derivatives) with respect to the indices that follow it. Before delving further, let us backtrack and discuss the assumptions that must be made to come to this result. Perhaps the most important assumption is that the source velocities are much less than the speed of light--this is called the <i>slow-motion limit</i>; without making this assumption, we cannot use the quadrupole approximation for GW generation. Additionally, this assumption implies that $T^{00}$ (the energy density) is the dominant term in $T^{\\mu\\nu}$, and that this term is dominated by the Newtonian mass density: $T^{00} \\approx \\rho c^2$. Further, we must assume that the origin of our coordinate system is contained in the source, that the wavelength of the emitted GWs is much larger than the size of the source, that the point at which we are measuring the GW amplitude is far from the source, and that the time derivatives of $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ are small. Although this seems like we are making lots of assumptions (which we are) which would restrict the validity of the results, these assumptions actually work well as approximations to all but the most exotic systems (such as binary compact objects or coalescing systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Quadrupole Moment Tensor and the TT-Gauge ###\n",
    "The quadrupole moment tensor is typically first introduced in an in-depth analysis of GW generation of a sinusoidally oscillating source. I'd rather not go over the entire derivation, so I'll just state the result (as with the rest of what has been discussed, all of the relevant information can be found in greater detail in introductory texts on GR):\n",
    "$$ Q^{lm} := \\int T^{00}x^lx^m\\mathrm{d^3x} $$\n",
    "Again, the indices are referring to <i>spatial</i> components of the tensor. Now, as we'll understand later, it is useful to describe an object called the \"reduced\" quadrupole moment:\n",
    "$$ q_{lm} := Q_{lm} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{lm}Q^j_j $$\n",
    "where $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker-delta, defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\delta_{jk} = \\biggl\\{ \\begin{aligned} 1, & & j=k\\\\ 0, & & j \\neq k \\end{aligned} $$\n",
    "Now, this quantity--the reduced quadrupole moment--is important because it is what we use to find the metric perturbations in what's called the <i>transverse-traceless gauge</i> (or TT-gauge, for short). To put it simply, the TT-gauge is a choice of gauge conditions (which are infinitesimal coordinate transformations in GR) which reveal the two physical polarizations of GWs. Additionally, the metric perturbation takes the simplest form in this gauge, and the <i>coordinate</i> separation between points stays fixed--the points in spacetime \"wiggle\" with the gravitational wave. Surprisingly, the <i>physical</i> separation between fixed points (the <i>proper distance</i>, measured by integrating the line element over the coordinate separation) does not stay constant! In fact, it is this result that the LIGO detector is based on. As with the rest of the paper, I'll just list the results of working in the TT-gauge. We find that GWs are transverse, circularly polarized waves, with two independent modes (called the \"plus\" and \"cross\" modes) that are rotated $45^\\circ$ relative to each other. Further, in the TT-gauge, the metric perturbation takes the form:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{h}^{TT}_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & f_+(t-r) & f_\\times(t-r) & 0\\\\ 0 & f_\\times(t-r) & -f_+(t-r) & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "Additionally, the metric perturbation in the TT-gauge is given by:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} & = \\frac{1}{r}\\left[q_{xx,00}(t-r)-q_{yy,00}(t-r)\\right]\\\\ \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} & = \\frac{2}{r}q_{xy,00}(t-r) \\end{aligned} $$\n",
    "However, this result is given in geometrized units; though it is more convenient to work in geometrized units, we must convert back to MLT (Mass, Length, Time) units when making predictions based off this model:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} & = \\frac{G}{c^4r}\\left[q_{xx,00}(t-\\frac{r}{c})-q_{yy,00}(t-\\frac{r}{c})\\right]\\\\ \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} & = \\frac{2G}{c^4r}q_{xy,00}(t-\\frac{r}{c}) \\end{aligned} $$\n",
    "Note that the metric perturbation is dimensionless: GWs impart time-dependent strains on systems composed of coordinate-fixed masses--that is, GWs induce time-varying stretching and compressing of rigid bodies! Now, if I am not mistaken, the quadrupole approximation formalism has been fully developed (for our purposes), and all other relevant details have been sufficiently discussed. So I now turn my attention to the simulation details."

    "## The Simulation ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of the Process ###\n",
    "This simulation sets out to model the GWs produced by stars in a Keplerian orbit. The method with which I will generate the GW data is often referred to as the \"post-Newtonian\" approximation. It begins by modeling the binary system with the two-body, central force problem of classical mechanics, where the force in question is Newtonian gravity. Now, every paper and textbook that explores this topic--the characteristics of GWs generated by binary systems--notes that the quadrupole formalism is only valid for systems that are dominated by non-gravitational forces; however, the authors also note (and it should be evident from the form of the quadrupole moment) that the result depends only on the motions of the masses, so the nature of the force can sort of be glossed over and the results will remain valid as an order-of-magnitude estimate. The Keplerian orbits are then used in computing the quadrupole moment, which is in turn used to compute the components of the metric perturbation, as well as the amplitude of the perturbation. I will discuss the method in more depth below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Two-Body, Central Force Problem ###\n",
    "The two-body problem is typically first addressed in depth in an advanced undergraduate course on mechanics--it sets out to understand the dynamics of a system of two particles that interact via some central force. The problem begins with six degrees of freedom (from here onwards I'll denote n-degrees of freedom as \"n-DOF\")--as each particle can move in any spatial direction. We begin by defining the system using the generalized coordinates $\\{x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2\\}$:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align} \\vec{r}_1 = \\vec{r}_1(x_1, y_1, z_1)\\\\ \\vec{r}_2 = \\vec{r}_2(x_2, y_2, z_2) \\end{align} $$\n",
    "For simplicity, we also define the total mass $M = m_1 + m_2$ and the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_1m_2}{M}$. For two particles interacting via a conservative, central force ($\\vec{F} = -\\nabla U$), the Lagrangian is:\n",
    "$$ \\mathscr{L} = \\frac{1}{2}m_1\\dot{\\vec{r}}_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_2\\dot{\\vec{r}}_2^2 - U(\\|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2\\|)$$,\n",
    "where a dot indicates a (total) time derivative. To reduce this problem to 3-DOF, we first define the center of mass (CM) position, $\\vec{R}$, and the relative position, $\\vec{r}$, as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align} & \\vec{R} = \\frac{m_1\\vec{r}_1 + m_2\\vec{r}_2}{M}, \\quad & & \\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2\\\\ & \\vec{r}_1 = \\vec{R} + \\frac{m_2}{M}\\vec{r}, \\quad & & \\vec{r}_2 = \\vec{R} -\\frac{m_1}{M}\\vec{r} \\end{align} $$\n",
    "A few lines of algebra reveals the Lagrangian in these new coordinates:\n",
    "$$ \\mathscr{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\dot{\\vec{r}}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{\\vec{R}}^2 - U(r) $$\n",
    "Since the Lagrangian is independent of $\\vec{R}$, that coordinate is ignorable--in fact, the ignorability of the CM coordinate corresponds to conservation of linear momentum! Let's see what the consequence is:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{gather}  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{P}}{\\mathrm{dt}} = 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow  m_1\\dot{\\vec{r}}_1 + m_2\\dot{\\vec{r}}_2 = 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow  M\\dot{\\vec{R}} = 0 \\end{gather} $$\n",
    "So the center of mass moves with constant velocity--a consequence that allows us to choose an intertial frame (called the CM frame) whose origin coincides with the CM position and which is comoving with the CM. This removes the CM coordinate from the Lagrangian, effectively reducing the problem to 3-DOF. To reduce this problem further, we note that the system is free of any external torque, so its total angular momentum must be constant. In particular, the <i>direction</i> of the system's angular momentum is constant, so we can rotate our coordinate system such that the xy-plane is orthogonal to the system's angular momentum. Since the motion of particles in a torque-free system is orthogonal to the system's angular momentum in an inertial frame, this effectively reduces the problem to 2-DOF: $\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}(x,y)$. We can reduce the problem further by switching to plane-polar coordinates $(r,\\phi)$ and examining the resulting Lagrangian and equations of motion:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{gather} \\mathscr{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu r^2\\dot{\\phi}^2 - U(r)\\\\ \\mu\\ddot{r} = r\\dot{\\phi}^2 - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{dr}}\\\\ \\mu r^2\\dot{\\phi} = \\mathrm{const.} \\end{gather} $$\n",
    "Dimensionally, the quantity $\\mu r^2\\dot{\\phi}$ corresponds to angular momentum, so we can define the constant in the $\\phi$ equation as the angular momentum, $\\ell$, and get the equation $\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{\\ell}{\\mu r^2}$. This can be substituted into the radial equation, which effectively reduces the problem to 1-DOF. Now, it's possible to analytically determine the solution to the radial equation, but the derivation is unimportant for understanding the physics (and this particular application), so I'll just state the result:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{gather} r(\\phi) = \\frac{c}{1+\\epsilon\\cos(\\phi)}, \\quad \\mathrm{where}\\\\ c = \\frac{\\ell^2}{\\gamma\\mu}, \\qquad \\epsilon=\\left(\\frac{2\\ell^2E}{\\gamma^2\\mu} + 1\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}, \\gamma = Gm_1m_2 \\end{gather} $$\n",
    "This is the orbit equation that will be used (in conjunction with the $\\phi$ equation) to generate the data for animating the orbital dynamics of the GW sources I'm interested in. Note that the orbit equations for the individual stars (in Cartesian coordinates) can be recovered by the following transformations:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{gather} x_1 = \\frac{m_2}{M}r\\cos(\\phi), \\qquad y_1 = \\frac{m_2}{M}r\\sin(\\phi)\\\\ x_2 = -\\frac{m_1}{M}r\\cos(\\phi), \\qquad y_2 = -\\frac{m_1}{M}r\\sin(\\phi) \\end{gather} $$\n",
    "These are the trajectories that will be inserted into the integral for computing the system's quadrupole moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the Metric Perturbations ###\n",
    "Now, I would like to adjust the focus to computing $h_{\\mu\\nu}$. Let us begin by recalling the relevant equations (in geometrized units):\n",
    "$$ \\begin{gather} \\bar{h}^{TT}_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} & \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} & 0\\\\ 0 & \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} & -\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} = \\frac{1}{r}\\left[q_{xx,00}(t-r) - q_{yy,00}(t-r)\\right], \\qquad \\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} = \\frac{2}{r}q_{xy,00}(t-r)\\\\ q_{lm} = Q_{lm} - \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{lm}Q^j_j\\\\ Q^{jk} = \\int T^{00}x^jx^k\\mathrm{d^3x} \\end{gather} $$\n",
    "Given this, the method is pretty straightforward: compute $Q^{jk}$, use the result to get $q^{jk}$, evaluate its second time derivatives at the retarded time $t_{\\mathrm{ret}} = t - r$, and plug the results into the expressions for $\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx}$ and $\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy}$. A general GW is a linear combination of its two polarizations, so the amplitude of the GW can be estimated to order-of-magnitude via $\\|\\bar{h}\\| = \\left(\\|\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx}\\|^2 + \\|\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy}\\|^2\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}$, since $\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xx} = -\\bar{h}^{TT}_{yy}$ and $\\bar{h}^{TT}_{xy} = \\bar{h}^{TT}_{yx}$. So now the only remaining problem is to determine the form of the quadrupole moment: can it be solved exactly, or must it be numerically integrated?\n",
    "\n",
    "To greatly simplify this problem, I will assume that the stars in orbit are point masses. Since we're restricting attention to the weak-field, slow-motion limit, $T^{00}$ is just the mass-energy density. In geometrized units, this takes the form:\n",

    "When the (translated) delta function ($\\delta(x-x_0)$) is integrated over any interval $[x_1, x_2]$ such that $x_0\\in[x_1, x_2]$, the result is unity.

    "This problem is treated in practically every introductory text on GR, and the results presented here are in agreement with the numerous texts that explore this simple problem: GWs from binary stars in circular orbits have amplitudes of order $\\frac{G^2M\\mu}{Dl_0c^4}$, oscillate at twice the orbital frequency $\\Omega = 2\\omega$, and (as mentioned earlier) consist of two linearly independent polarizations that are out of phase by $45^\\circ$. The agreement of the results is reassuring--surely, if the functional forms I found were the correct results for the more general problem of Keplerian orbits with nontrivial (yet still elliptic) eccentricities, then they must reduce to the correct form when applied to the simpler problem of circular orbits. With all these quantities defined, it looks like we now have enough information to run the simulation. First, however, I would like to make some closing remarks.\n",

    "## Closing Remarks ##\n",
    "One piece of functionality that I would like to include, but have not been able to due to time constraints, is the system's energy (and angular momentum) loss due to gravitational radiation. Although I have not written the code to account for this (nor have I explored the problem on paper), I can briefly describe what would happen qualitatively. As the system radiates gravitationally, the orbital energy decreases, which leads to smaller separations and acts to circularize the orbit. This, in turn, causes the GW signature to change in response. It turns out that the average luminosity of a GW source is proportional to the time-averaged value of the inner product of the quadrupole moment's third time derivatives--a computation which I am not willing to do at this time (mainly because the deadline is fast approaching and allowing for variable eccentricity/energy/angular momentum greatly complicates the problem)."
